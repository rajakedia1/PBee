PBee

PBee is an initiative taken to solve the problem of Parking in Cities. This easy to handle app can solve the issue of not getting an empty parking space easily even after the concept of Multi Level parking is introduced. The matter is, people donâ€™t get to know whether there is any vacant space or not in the parking lots they are approaching. PBee can easily address to this situation and will give unexpected results.
